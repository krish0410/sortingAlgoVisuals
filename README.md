# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer!

**Sorting Algorithm Visualizer** is a web application designed to better understand sorting algorithms used in **DATA STRUCTURE** by displaying and visualizing them.
In the website you can find information and implementations in multiple programming languages such as C/C++/JAVA of more than 15 sorting algorithms, categorized by their time and space complexity.

## The sorting algorithms currently available are:

- Quick Sort
- Merge Sort
- Heap Sort
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Gnome Sort
- Shaker Sort
- Odd Even Sort
- Pancake Sort
- Bitonic Sort
- Radix Sort
- Shell Sort
- Comb Sort
- Bogo Sort

## Custom Sort

It's also possible to design and visualize _your own sorting algorithm. Have fun messing around and trying new stuff!

## Running locally

To run the project locally, install Python 3 on your machine, clone the repository, install all the dependencies and run the `app.py` file.

```console
git clone https://github.com/krish0410/sortingAlgoVisuals
cd sortvisualizer
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```
